# WhyNot2
SoT Hackfest project
We've decided to continue the project after the Hackfest.

WhyNot, an android app to show you whats going on near you, right now.

WhyNot currently uses the EventFinda API to find events within a certain radius of the user.
It's features are:
- Display events as cards in a RecyclerView
- Display events on a map using different markers
- Expand cards into a full Activity when touched

We are looking to implement:
- A preferences section that allows the user which events they'd like to see based on category
(split into 6 different categories), distance and whether the event is free/paid.
- Facebook integration
- Possibly a Watchlist feature that allows the user to save events to come back to later.

Being developed by Vinne, James, Taran, Marek and George
